Vagrant-Up-Script
=================

### Just a post ```vagrant up``` shell script

This script installs the latest version of Node.js. I'll do more with it later.   
Considering this is literally the first shell script I've ever written, I'm just glad it works.  

Thanks to [@Svpernova09](https://github.com/svpernova09) for the recommendation.
