Vagrant-Up-Script
=================

### Just a post ```vagrant up``` bash script

This script installs the latest version of Node.js. I'm sure I'll be adding more to it later on.   
Considering this is literally the first shell script I've ever written, I'm just glad it works.  

Thanks to [@Svpernova09](https://github.com/svpernova09) for the help.
